Well after two years in Brasil as a <a href="http://mormon.org/missionary-work">missionary</a> for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I'm back on the development scene. I've been soaking in all the updates in technology and will decide where I'm going to jump in! Stay tuned.
<br/><br/>
I've refreshed the site a bit, although not much has changed visually. The code, however, got an extensive refresh.
The next step will be to update the site to use the latest version of Bootstrap.
