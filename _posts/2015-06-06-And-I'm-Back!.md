Well after two years in Brasil as a <a href="http://mormon.org/missionary-work">missionary</a> for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I'm back on the development scene. I've been soaking in all the updates in technology and will decide where I'm going to jump in! Stay tuned.

I've refreshed the site a bit, although not much has changed visually. The code, however, got an extensive refresh. 
The next step will be to update the site to use the latest version of Bootstrap.
