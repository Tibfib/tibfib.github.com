It's time for my second blog post!<br/><br/>
For the next two years I will be in Brazil, teaching people about Jesus Christ. I'm really grateful for this opportunity. As a result, I will not be doing any programming or even any application support. So, I've suspended all my apps from the webOS App Catalog. Their source is, as always, available on <a href="http://github.com/{{ site.author.github }}" target="_blank" title="Github">Github</a>.<br/><br/>
It'll be crazy to see the changes in technology upon my return. I'm super excited to dive back into the app development scene in a couple years. Knowing I was going to be leaving the country for a while has really made me limit my app development time, so it'll be great to be back, full-throttle.<br/><br/>
If you're interested more in what I'll be doing, please see <a href="http://mormon.org/missionary-work">Mormon.org</a>.<br/><br/>
See you in two!
