Welcome to the new tibfib.com!<br/><br/>
I've decided to move away from WordPress am now using Jekyll. It's a minimalist blogging platform that can be hosted by github.com/pages. It's pretty awesome. I also used JekyllBootstrap to help me get started, and made a custom theme using Twitter's excellent Bootstrap.<br/><br/>
I'm pretty happy with the result. I decided to remove comments so let me know what you think by tweeting or emailing me!
